The US government's Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds the continuum of care (COC) in major cities and select rural areas across the USA.

As a requirement for receiving funding, every COC must conduct a Point In Time (PIT) count.  One night every year a group of service providers and volunteers in each city surveys and counts the homeless individuals and families.  Additionally, COCs must provide a Housing Inventory Count (HIC) and maintain a Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) database.  While the HMIS database is not open to the public, HUD makes available the PIT and HIC data from across the country.  https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2020-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html

Nationwide, there is a disturbing rising trend in the percentage of unsheltered homeless.

We also see this trend in Indianapolis, especially in 2021.  Here in Indianapolis, the agency known as CHIP (Coalition for Homelessness Intervention and Prevention) is the coordinating entity to ensure our city meets HUD reporting requirements.  Some information on the 2021 PIT cound here in Indy can be found at:  https://www.chipindy.org/reports.html

This proposal will use the HUD nationwide PIT and HIC datasets for COCs in the United States combined with population and homelessness funding allocation data to evaluate if machine learning models can identify factors (investment in low barrier shelter beds, investment in housing first units, federal funding levels, etc) which lead to better outcomes (lower homelessness as a percentage of city population).

Additional datasets that will be pulled into this analysis include HUD funding levels at the programmatic level accross the COCs and population data available from the US Census.  The hypothesis for this project is that we will be able to correlate certain factors across these broad nation-wide data sets with homelessness outcomes.  Successful homelessness outcomes for this project will be defined by cities with the lowest percent of unsheltered and/or unsheltered homeless as a percentage of the city's population.  These findings would then be the first step in helping to guide additional dialog and potentially new investments in our city of Indianapolis.  Currently the Mayor of Indianapolis has a proposal to spend 12.5 million dollars on a new low barrier shelter which would include additional transitional beds. Does our modeling provide evidence in support of this proposal?
